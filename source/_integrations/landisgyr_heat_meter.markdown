The Landis+Gyr Heat Meter integration for Home Assistant allows you to read the meter values from Ultraheat devices by Landis & Gyr. These devices are commonly used for district heating. The integration has been tested with the Landis & Gyr Ultraheat 50 (UH50), type LUGCUH50. Other models are likely to work as well.

The device is read through the optical interface. An (USB) IR reader is needed and connected to Home Assistant.

## Sensors

The integration will create the following sensors:

- Heat usage (MWh or GJ)
- Volume usage (m3)

Depending on your device type, heat usage is read as GJ or MWh.

Further data that is read from the device is added as diagnostic entities:

- Heat usage measured (GJ or MWh, depending on device type)
- Ownership number
- Volume previous year (m3)
- Heat previous year (GJ or MWh, depending on device type)
- Error number
- Device number
- Measurement period minutes
- Power max (kW)
- Power max previous year (kW)
- Flow rate max (m3ph)
- Flow rate max previous year (m3ph)
- Flow temperature max (째C)
- Return temperature max (째C)
- Flow temperature max previous year (째C)
- Return temperature max previous year (째C)
- Operating hours
- Fault hours
- Fault hours previous year
- Yearly set day
- Monthly set day
- Meter date time
- Measuring range (m3ph)
- Settings and firmware
- Flow hours

## Energy Dashboard

Either heat usage or volume usage can be used as "Gas" on the energy dashboard. 

## Polling the device

Polling is by default done on restart and once per day. Every time the Heat Meter values are read, battery time of the device will (supposedly) go down by approximately 30 minutes.

For detailed control on polling and time of polling, consider disabling polling in the integration panel and poll manually. For instructions, see below.

### Polling manually (optional)

For detailed control on when the device is polled, disable the default polling for this integration and create an automation that will update one of the entities (the other entities will be updated as well).

If you're comfortable with YAML, this code could be used:

```yaml
alias: "Heat Meter manual update"
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "23:30:00"
action:
  - service: homeassistant.update_entity
    target:
      entity_id: sensor.heat_meter_heat_usage_gj
```
